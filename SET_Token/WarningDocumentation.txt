Compiler warings:

WARNING:
-Potential Violation of Checks-Effects-Interaction pattern in DividendPayingToken.payDividendInEther(address,uint256): Could potentially lead to re-entrancy vulnerability.
RESPONSE:
-the onlyOwner modifier avoids re-entrency from third pary accouts

WARNING:
-use of "now": "now" does not mean current time. Now is an alias for block.timestamp. Block.timestamp can be influenced by miners to a certain degree, be careful.
RESPONSE:
-"now" is used to unlock tokens after lock-up period is over, using blocktime gives a maximum discrepency of 20sec. which is OK.
